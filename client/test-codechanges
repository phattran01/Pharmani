Slide 1:
Project Overview

Goal: Develop a React web application for an enterprise-wide employee directory.

Objectives:

    Enable employees to search for other employees in the directory.
    Provide essential employee information, including name, phone number, job role, work location, and salary.
    Implement salary confidentiality rules:
        Employees can view their own salary.
        Managers can view the salary of their direct reports.
        HR employees can view anyone's salary.

Slide 2:
Building the Application

Goal: Create a robust web application using MongoDB as the backend and Node.js as the web service.

Objectives:

    Utilize MongoDB to store and retrieve employee data.
    Develop a Node.js web service to handle data operations.
    Implement a responsive and user-friendly web application using React.

Slide 3:
Data Analysis

Goal: Build a solution to predict salary based on job role and location.

Objectives:

    Generate and populate the MongoDB database with a minimum of 1000 dummy data records.
    Train a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn to predict salary.
    Create a React component that communicates with the model via a RESTful service.
    Enable the user to input job role and location and display the predicted salary.

Slide 4:
Implementation Details

    Backend:
        Use MongoDB as the backend database.
        Develop a Node.js web service to handle CRUD operations.
        Ensure data security and privacy.

    Frontend:
        Build the web application using React.
        Implement an intuitive and responsive user interface.
        Enable efficient searching and browsing of the employee directory.

    Salary Prediction:
        Generate dummy data using a script and populate the database.
        Train a Linear Regression model in scikit-learn to predict salaries.
        Integrate the model with the React frontend using a RESTful service.

Slide 5:
Conclusion

    Achieved Goals:
        Developed a React web application for an enterprise-wide employee directory.
        Implemented salary confidentiality rules for viewing employee salaries.
        Built a data analysis solution to predict salary based on job role and location.

    Benefits:
        Improved employee search and information retrieval process.
        Enhanced data security and privacy for confidential salary information.
        Enabled salary prediction to assist in decision-making processes.

    Future Enhancements:
        Expand the functionality to include additional employee information.
        Implement user authentication and access control for improved security.
        Enhance the predictive model by incorporating additional factors.
